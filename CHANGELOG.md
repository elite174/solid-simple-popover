# 1.6.0
- Added `disabled` prop which disables triggering popover. Popover now also looks at `disabled` state of triggering html element.

# 1.5.0

- Added new prop: `closeOnEscape`. If `true` (by default) the popover will be closed if `Escape` key pressed.
- `ignoreOutsideInteraction` => `closeOnOutsideInteraction` (`true` by default)
